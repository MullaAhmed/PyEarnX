# PyEarnX

This repository is python based backend for EarnX, a web3-based video-sharing platform that makes it easy to watch online videos and earn from them. You can even create projects and upload your own videos to the projects. Based on the views, votes, and likes the creator will receive web3 tokens as a reward.
